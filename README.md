HARDWARE MONITOR
===============
Created by UnknowTM

A real-time system monitoring application that tracks hardware performance across multiple computers.

DESCRIPTION
----------
This application provides real-time monitoring of computer hardware metrics including CPU, RAM, 
disk usage, and connected USB devices. It features a modern web interface with visual indicators 
and automatic updates.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
-----------------
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Node.js 14 or higher
- Modern web browser
- SQLite3

INSTALLATION
-----------

1. Frontend Setup:
   -------------
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm start
   
   The web interface will be available at: http://localhost:3000

2. Backend Setup:
   ------------
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python main.py
   
   The API server will run at: http://localhost:5001

3. Client Agent Setup:
   ----------------
   cd client-agent
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python client-agent.py

FEATURES
--------
- Real-time hardware monitoring
- Visual status indicators
- Automatic data refresh (5-second intervals)
- USB device detection
- Responsive web interface
- Cross-platform compatibility

ARCHITECTURE
-----------
- Frontend: React.js with Bootstrap
- Backend: FastAPI with SQLite
- Client: Python with psutil

API ENDPOINTS
------------
GET  /health          - Service health check
GET  /get-hardware    - Retrieve hardware metrics
POST /update-hardware - Update hardware data
GET  /add-test-data  - Add sample data (testing only)

FOLDER STRUCTURE
---------------
/frontend           - React web interface
  /public          - Static assets
  /src             - Source code
    /MyComponents  - React components
/backend           - FastAPI server
  main.py          - Server implementation
  requirements.txt - Python dependencies
/client-agent      - Monitoring client
  requirements.txt - Client dependencies

TROUBLESHOOTING
--------------
1. No Data Showing:
   - Verify backend is running (http://localhost:5001/health)
   - Check client agent is running
   - Confirm database exists and has permissions

2. Connection Issues:
   - Verify correct ports (3000 for frontend, 5001 for backend)
   - Check CORS settings in backend
   - Ensure firewall allows connections

3. Database Issues:
   - Check SQLite file permissions
   - Verify table schema matches expected format

DEVELOPMENT
----------
1. Running Tests:
   Frontend: npm test
   Backend: pytest

2. Building for Production:
   Frontend: npm run build
   Backend: Use gunicorn for deployment

SECURITY NOTES
-------------
- Default configuration allows all CORS origins
- No authentication implemented
- Intended for internal network use only
